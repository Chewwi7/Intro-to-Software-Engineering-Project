# Technology Selection

## Language

Our team will be programming our solution in C#. We decided to go with this language because most of us have either used it already or know a similar language (such as Java). It's also a popular language, and will add value to our resumes.

## Frameworks

For our back-end framework, we will be using ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core is cross platform, high-performing, has great integration with Visual Studio Code, and is overall a very versatile and capable framework for building web applications, which is why we decided to go with it.

For our front-end framework, we will be using Bootstrap. It's the most well known and widely used CSS framework, and also considered one of the most beginner friendly due to it's simplicity through it's pre-styled UI components and it's large community.



## Storage Plan

We'll be storing our data in SQL



## Operating Environments

We want our application to be as cross compatible as possible, so we'll be creating a web application. As a result, it will be compatible with pretty much every non-mobile operating environment, including operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.



## Additional Software

We'll be using GitHub to collaborate on and share our code. We'll be using YouTrack to create a Gantt chart that lists and track our various project milestones and tasks.
