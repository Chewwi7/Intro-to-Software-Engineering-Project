# Technology Selection

## Language

Our team will be programming our solution in C#. We decided to go with this language because most of us have either used it already or know a similar language (such as Java). It's also a popular language and will add value to our resumes.

## Frameworks

For our back-end framework, we will be using ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core is cross-platform, high-performing has great integration with Visual Studio Code, and is overall a very versatile and capable framework for building web applications, which is why we decided to go with it.

For our front-end framework, we will be using Bootstrap. It's the most well-known and widely used CSS framework and is also considered one of the most beginner-friendly due to its simplicity through its pre-styled UI components and its large community.



## Storage Plan

We'll be storing our data using JSON. It's easy to read and write, has excellent web integration, and has a great number of resources and libraries available for us to receive guidance from. It's also in-demand in today's job market, so we believe it would be worth while to learn.



## Operating Environments

We want our application to be as cross-compatible as possible, so we'll be creating a web application. As a result, it will be compatible with pretty much every non-mobile operating environment, including operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and Linux.



## Additional Software

We'll be using GitHub to collaborate on and share our code and YouTrack to create a Gantt chart that lists and tracks our various project milestones and tasks. We'll also be using Marvel to create a mockup of our web application's user interface.
