# Technology Selection
The following are languages and framework chosen by the developers to implement the LootX website:

[//]: # (Will research good reasons for selection)
## Languages
- ### C#:
    - Comprehensive Syntax: C# has concise syntax that helps save time with development
    - Available Online Documentation: C# has a lot of source code and documentation online which is helpful with dealing with 
  bugs and errors during implementation
    - Growing Community: Ranked #6 on trending programming languages in 2023, C# is a widely used language. 
  It's popularity will make expanding our team easier when looking for C# developers
    - High Scalability: The static coding nature of C# allows engineers to easily make adjustments and expand on
  any functionality within the developed/developing program

- ### HTML: 
  - Widely used build structure: HTML is a widely used Markup language for web development
  with a lot of troubleshooting information and experts readily available
  - Supported on all browsers: HTML can be supported by almost every single browser in the world,
  if not all
  - Simple Syntax: HTML has syntax that is easily comprehensible by many programmers and easy to learn
 and use
  - Integrates with other languages: HTML can also be integrated with other languages such as CSS, Javascript and
  C# as is being used in this project

- ### CSS
  - Easily used and paired with HTML: CSS has very simple syntax and enables developers to enhance user experience 
  by adding style to HTML components in a website
  - Faster page speed: CSS allows developers to add more features for less code through frameworks such as
  Bootstrap. Less code helps webpages load faster

## Frameworks
- ### ASP.NET Core 
  - Set up Authentication System: ASP.NET has template pages such as user login and homepage setup and also a database which saves time with
  setting up
  - Fast and Efficient: Websites built with ASP.NET are relatively faster and more efficient than websites built with other frameworks
  such as PHP.
  - Compiles code to object code: This feature allows us to quickly resolve issues with our code
  - Compatible on all Computer OS: ASP.NET Core is newer and works across all major computer operating systems
  - High Level of Interactivity: ASP.NET Core are relatively more interactive but require more coding to make it 
  more responsive to users
  - Easy to Use Maintain: This framework provides features such as auto-scaling which helps add, adjust and expand our website as user
  demand changes

- ### Bootstrap
  - Pre-built components: Bootstrap offers a wide range of pre-build components such as buttons,
  forms, navigation bars, windows and more which saves coding time and effort, hence efficient
  - Customizable: Bootstrap does not only allow you to set up design with created templates but also allows
  developers to create templates and customize already existing components.
  - Open Source: Bootstrap is open source and free, saving cost with our UI design.
